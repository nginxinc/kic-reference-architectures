## Style Guides

### Git Style Guide

* Keep a clean, concise and meaningful git commit history on your branch,
  rebasing locally and squashing before submitting a PR
* Use the
  [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) format
  when writing a commit message, so that changelogs can be automatically
  generated
* Follow the guidelines of writing a good commit message as described
  [here](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/) and summarised in the next
  few points
  * In the subject line, use the present tense
    ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
  * In the subject line, use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not
    "Moves cursor to...")
  * Limit the subject line to 72 characters or less
  * Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the subject line
  * Add more detailed description in the body of the git message (
    `git commit -a` to give you more space and time in your text editor to
    write a good message instead of `git commit -am`)

### Code Style Guide

* Python code should conform to the
  [PEP-8 style guidelines](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/)
  whenever possible.
* Where feasible, include unit tests.
