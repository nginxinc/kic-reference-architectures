# Directory

`<repository-root>/extras`

## Purpose

This directory is for files that, although important, don't have a clearly
defined home. Files from this directory will most likely be moved as the
project matures.

## Key Files

* [`jwt.token`](./jwt.token) This file contains the JWT required to pull
  the NGINX IC from the NGINX, Inc registry. See
  [this webpage](https://docs.nginx.com/nginx-ingress-controller/installation/using-the-jwt-token-docker-secret)
  for details and examples.
* [`jenkins`](./jenkins) This directory contains sample jenkinsfiles. Note
  that these are not guaranteed to be production ready. These files are named
  according to the specific type of build they manage; for example, AWS, K3S,
  MicroK8s, and DO (Digital Ocean).

## Notes

None.
