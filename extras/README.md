## Directory
`<repository-root>/extras`

## Purpose
This directory is for files that, although important, don't have a clearly defined home. Files from this
directory will most likely be moved as the project matures.

## Key Files
- [`jwt.token`](./jwt.token) This file contains the JWT required to pull the NGINX IC from the NGINX, Inc
registry. See [this webpage](https://docs.nginx.com/nginx-ingress-controller/installation/using-the-jwt-token-docker-secret)
for details and examples.

## Notes
None.
